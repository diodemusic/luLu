 A discord bot that uses machine learning to predict the outcome of in-progress League of Legends games.

ToDo list:
- [] add an argument for different regions
- [] use the to_json() method of the json library on the leagues object so that one column being N/A doesnt apply N/A to the entire row
- [] add a command that gets the current status of every league of legends server (detect which regions are down)
- [] train a machine learning model to predict game outcomes based on the currently fetched metrics
