# luLu
 A discord bot that uses machine learning to predict the outcome of in-progress League of Legends games.

todo list:
add an argument for different regions
use the to_json() method of the json library on the leagues object so that one thing being N/A doesnt apply N/A to the entire row
add a command that gets the current status of every league of legends server (detect which regions are down)
train a machine learning model to predict game outcomes based on the currently fetched metrics
